## Research Question 

Since I came to Penn State, I have learned a lot about other countries. However, I feel like I still haven't learned anything about India yet. Therefore, I decided to analyze some second hand vehicle market data from India.  

+ What are the factors that are affecting the selling price of used cars in India?
+ Are cars with automatic transmission generally more expensive than cars with manual transmission?(in my theory automatic transmission should be more expensive)
+ Is the data from Indian market same as the US market? 

Specific data and plots can be found at 

## Challenge 
+ My biggest challenge is when trying to combine two tables, the India table has capital cased transmission (Automatic/Manual) while the US table has lower cased (automatic/manual). In order to effectively compare two data sets, I took hours of work to figure this way - lower case the entire column instead of matching

## Key Takeaway
+ According to the data from India, since the p-value is less than 0.05, we can conclude that transmission, fuel, km_driven, year, seller type, and number of owners are significant predictors of selling price in the India market. 
+ For India market, the selling price for auto transmission is significantly higher than manual transmission. 
+ In comparison, the selling price for auto transmission and manual transmission are about the same in the US. 
+ The Indian market favors automatic transmission while the Us market is indifferent.
